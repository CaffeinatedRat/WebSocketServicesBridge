# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# websocketservicesbridge: Configuration for the WebSocketServicesBridge.
#   active: True if the WebSocketServicesBridge is running.
#   portNumber: The port number your bridge will be running on.
#   logging: Logs to the console (0 = off, 1 = simple, 2 = verbose).
#   maximumConnections: Sets the maximum number of connections the server can handle concurrently.
#   handshakeTimeOutTolerance: Sets the number of milliseconds that the server will wait for a handshake to complete.
#   frameTimeOutTolerance: Sets the number of milliseconds that the server will wait for a frame to complete before terminating the connection.
#   maximumFragmentationSize: Sets the maximum number of frames that can be sent in a single request to your server.  The higher this value is the more likely someone can reduce your servers performance if they flood you with large size requests.
#   checkOrigin: Determines if the origin is valid during the handshake.  If the origin is null, it is invalid and the connection is rejected.
#   whitelist: Determines if the websocket services are only available to certain ips.  Note that this checks the origin header field during the handshake and can be spoofed by non-browser clients.
#   pingable: Determines if the server is pingable via websockets (This is reserved as a future feature as most browers do not support a websocket ping method).
#   muteDisabledServices: Silences the response from all services and extensions that are disabled.
# services: Configuration for service states, where the following states are supported:
#   1) active - Where the service is overridden by the Bridge and returns with its own response.
#   2) passive - Where the service is passed onto each WebSocketServices.
#   WARNING: Service names are case sensitive.
# websocketservers: A list of websocketservers to bridge.
#   NameOfServer: The name (id) of your server and it cannot contain spaces.
#     address:  This is the address of the WebSocketServer.  It must contain address & port (IE: localhost:25564). 
#     restricted: Determines if the Bridge will communicate with this server.  If this is set to true the Bridge will NOT talk to this server.
